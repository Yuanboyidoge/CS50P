## Introduction
This Python script generates a PDF document for a business travel statement. It prompts the user to input relevant information such as name, student ID, dates of travel, location, travel route, hotel details, and road expenses. Then, it calculates the total expenses and generates a PDF document summarizing the business travel statement.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- fpdf library (`pip install fpdf`)

## Usage
1. Run the Python script.
2. Follow the prompts to input necessary information:
   - Name
   - Student ID

   - Location of business travel
   - Round trip route
   - Hotel name
   - Hotel unit price
   - Road fares (separated by spaces)
3. After providing the required information, the script will generate a PDF document named `OUTPUT.pdf` in the current directory.


## Output
The generated PDF document contains the following sections:
- Header: "Business Travel Statement"
